# P1 — Face Recognition & Authorization

Biometrics course project. Face-based user authorization system built on **InsightFace ArcFace** (ONNX runtime, no TensorFlow) with **ChromaDB** as the embedding vector store.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
venv/Scripts/pip install -r lab/face/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download the model

Downloads ArcFace weights to `lab/face/models/buffalo_l/`.

```bash
venv/Scripts/python lab/face/download_model.py
```

### 3. Download and prepare the dataset

Downloads FaceScrub from Google Drive, extracts the archives, and splits identities into four **mutually disjoint** sets.

```bash
venv/Scripts/python lab/face/download_data.py
```

Split is controlled by `lab/face/config.toml`:

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `seed` | `44` | Random seed for the split |
| `n_enrolled` | `100` | People added to the enrollment DB (≥ 80 required) |
| `train_ratio` | `0.70` | Share of remaining people used for training |
| `val_ratio` | `0.20` | Share used for validation |
| `test_ratio` | `0.10` | Share used for testing |

If you already have the data downloaded or extracted, skip those steps:

```bash
# zips already in data/raw/ — skip download
venv/Scripts/python lab/face/download_data.py --skip-download

# images already extracted — only re-split
venv/Scripts/python lab/face/download_data.py --skip-download --skip-extract
```

---

## Data storage

Face embeddings (512-d ArcFace vectors) are stored in a **ChromaDB** persistent vector database at `embeddings/chromadb/`. Raw images are **never** stored in the database — only the embeddings (project spec requirement).

ChromaDB uses an HNSW index with cosine distance, which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbour lookup for 1:N identification without scanning every stored embedding linearly.
